    <p>Cuttlefish are marine animals of the order <i class="taxonomy order">Sepiida</i>. They belong to the class
       <i class="taxonomy class">Cephalopoda</i>, which also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses.Cuttlefish have a
       unique internal shell, the <a href="physiology.html#cuttlebone">cuttlebone</a>. Despite their name, cuttlefish are not fish but molluscs.</p>
    <p>Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles
       furnished with denticulated suckers, with which they secure their prey.
        They generally range in size from 15 to 25 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr> (5.9 to 9.8 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>),
        with the largest species,<i class="taxonomy binomial"> Sepia apama</i>, reaching 50 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr>
        (20 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>) in mantle length and over 10.5 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> (23 <abbr title="pounds">lb<abbr>)
        in weight.</p>

    <p>Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopodes, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators include
       dolphins, sharks, fish, seals,seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The average life expectancy of a cuttlefish is about
       one to two years. Recent studies indicate cuttlefish are among the most intelligent invertebrates. Cuttlefish also
       have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain-to-body_mass_ratio">one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of
       all invertebrates</a></p>
    <p>The 'cuttle' in 'cuttlefish' comes from the Old English name for the species, <i lang="ang">cudele</i>, which may be cognate with the Old
       Norse <i lang="non">koddi</i> ('cushion')and the Middle Low German <i lang="nds">KÃ¼del</i> ('rag'). The Greco-Roman world
       valued the cuttlefish as a source of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from its siphon when it is alarmed.
       The word for it in both Greek and Latin, <i lang="la">sepia</i>, now refers to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepia-color">
         a brown pigment in English.</a></p>
